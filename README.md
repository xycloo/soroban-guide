## About
This repository serves the purpose of grouping Xycloo's resources to learn Soroban. Soroban is a smart contracts platform designed to work along with any transaction processor, specifically, it is being developed by the Stellar Development Foundation to interact with the Stellar blockchain.

## About Xycloo
We aim at becoming an important element of Stellar's, as well as Soroban's ecosystem. We are currently building on Stellar classic, but we are also prototyping on our local network some of the first DeFi protocols we indend to develop and deploy on Soroban.
